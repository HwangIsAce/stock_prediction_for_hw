** This repository contains a project for predicting Samsung's stock prices using LSTM and GRU models. The project was developed as part of a machine learning course assignment in 2021-2. It represents one of my first AI projects, exploring the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time-series forecasting.

## Project Overview
Goal: Predict Samsung's stock prices from January 1, 2021 to May 31, 2021 based on historical data.
Dataset: Samsung stock price data (21-01-01 ~ 21-05-31).
Models:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

## Features
Data preprocessing using MinMaxScaler for normalization.
Implementation of LSTM and GRU models for time-series prediction.
Comparison of model performance through loss metrics and visualization of predictions.
Visualization of actual vs predicted stock prices for better interpretability.

## Lessons Learned
Data Preprocessing: Understanding the importance of scaling and cleaning time-series data.
Model Selection: Learned the differences between LSTM and GRU and how they handle sequential data.
Evaluation: Gained experience in evaluating model performance and visualizing results.

## Future Work
Explore more advanced models like Transformer-based architectures for time-series data.
